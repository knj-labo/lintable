# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**lintable** - "One command · One extension · Every page is lintable"

This is a newly initialized JavaScript/Node.js project that aims to create a linting solution for web pages, potentially as a browser extension or command-line tool.

## Current Status

The project is in its initial setup phase with no source code implemented yet. The repository contains:
- Basic README.md with project name and tagline
- MIT License
- Comprehensive .gitignore for Node.js projects
- IntelliJ IDEA project configuration

## Development Setup

As the project develops, this section will be updated with:
- Build commands
- Test commands
- Linting commands
- Development server commands

## Architecture

The project structure and architecture will be documented here as it is implemented. Based on the project's tagline, expected components may include:
- A command-line interface
- Browser extension code
- Linting engine/rules
- Web page analysis capabilities

## Notes

- The project is configured to work with IntelliJ IDEA as a web module
- Claude AI settings are present, allowing find commands
- The .gitignore suggests this will be a JavaScript/Node.js project with potential use of frameworks like Next.js, Vue, or React
